# FloraSync - Is Moving

Look for the FloraSync Org -> We'll post the link as soon as the changes are finalized

We're making plants love technology.

It is the long-term goal of the FloraSync project to provide a library for farmers in emerging countries to develop an inexpensive 
agriculture tools to utilize strict water and power considerations.  Food grown indoors is a growing area of necessity in the United States and will continue to grow throughout the world's most populated cities.  It is the aim of FloraSync to help ease this transition and aide in the implementation of fully automated food systems that can run on solar, wind and water power.    

What is this?
A free set of open-source tools to piece together automatic watering systems and control units for gardens.  This software is intended for non-profit use only.   

If you'd like to participate or use the library I'd be happy to help.  You can find me on twitter at @SchuylerHSR.

Lastly, a generalization of my grand scheme is that even people in deserts can grow vegetables for fresh agriculture shorted areas of the world.  A basic setup would be a Rasberry Pi Web-server teamed with Arduino devices powered with RF24 radios farmers around the globe can built advanced automated watering systems that check soil moisture digitally and turn on a water pump/solenoid as needed.  

Feel free to comment and fork :)

Sincerely,
Schuyler Ankele
